Bismark report for: trimrrbs1_fq/RI-carcass-I_S46_L002_R1_001_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.19.0)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /data/gpfs/assoc/inbre/ix_genomes/vb_IscaW1_scaffolds/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	22697458
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	6815884
Mapping efficiency:	30.0%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	12190269
Sequences did not map uniquely:	3691305
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	3983

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	3401027	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	3410874	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
