Bismark report for: trimrrbs1_fq/Undetermined_S0_L002_R1_001_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.19.0)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /data/gpfs/assoc/inbre/ix_genomes/vb_IscaW1_scaffolds/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	62102826
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	2272043
Mapping efficiency:	3.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	58628648
Sequences did not map uniquely:	1202135
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	1092

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	1132711	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	1138240	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
